Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code:

```

class Solution {

```
Define a new class called Solution.


```

public:

```
Specify that the following members of the class are accessible from outside the class.

```

    vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    
```
Define a public member function called buildArray that takes a reference to a vector of integers (nums) as input and returns a vector of integers.

```

        int n = size(nums);
```

Create an integer variable n and set its value to the size of the input vector nums.

```
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
```
Start a for loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = n - 1.

```

            nums[i] = n * (nums[nums[i]] % n) + nums[i];
```
Update the value of nums[i] by adding n * (nums[nums[i]] % n) to it. This line stores the new value in the higher bits of each element in the nums vector while preserving the original value in the lower bits.

```

        }
```
End of the first for loop.

```

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
```
Start another for loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = n - 1.

```

            nums[i] = nums[i] / n;
```
Update the value of nums[i] by dividing it by n. This line extracts the new value from the higher bits of each element in the nums vector.

```

        }
```
End of the second for loop.

```

        return nums;
```
Return the modified nums vector as the final result.

```

    }
};
```
End of the buildArray function and the Solution class.â€‹
