Here's a line-by-line explanation of the given code:

cpp

Copy

class Solution {
Define a new class called Solution.

cpp

Copy

public:
Specify that the following members of the class are accessible from outside the class.

cpp

Copy

    vector<int> buildArray(vector<int>& nums) {
Define a public member function called buildArray that takes a reference to a vector of integers (nums) as input and returns a vector of integers.

cpp

Copy

        int n = size(nums);
Create an integer variable n and set its value to the size of the input vector nums.

cpp

Copy

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
Start a for loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = n - 1.

cpp

Copy

            nums[i] = n * (nums[nums[i]] % n) + nums[i];
Update the value of nums[i] by adding n * (nums[nums[i]] % n) to it. This line stores the new value in the higher bits of each element in the nums vector while preserving the original value in the lower bits.

cpp

Copy

        }
End of the first for loop.

cpp

Copy

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
Start another for loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = n - 1.

cpp

Copy

            nums[i] = nums[i] / n;
Update the value of nums[i] by dividing it by n. This line extracts the new value from the higher bits of each element in the nums vector.

cpp

Copy

        }
End of the second for loop.

cpp

Copy

        return nums;
Return the modified nums vector as the final result.

cpp

Copy

    }
};
End of the buildArray function and the Solution class.â€‹
