This is a C++ code that defines a class Solution with a member function generate that takes an integer numRows as input and returns a vector of vectors of integers as output. Each inner vector represents a row of Pascal's triangle and contains the corresponding values for that row.

Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code:


  class Solution {
  public:
      vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
  
This first line declares a class called Solution. The second line is the start of a member function called generate that takes an integer numRows as input and returns a vector of vectors of integers.


vector<vector<int>> generate(numRows);
This line declares a vector of vectors of integers called generate and initializes it with numRows outer vectors, each of which is initially empty.


  for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++){
      generate[i].resize(i+1);
      for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++){
         if(j == 0 || j == i){
             generate[i][j] = 1;
         } else{
         generate[i][j] = generate[i - 1][j - 1] + generate[i - 1][j];
         }
     }
  }
  
This block of code fills in the values of generate using a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates over the outer vectors of generate, from index 0 to numRows - 1. The inner loop iterates over the elements of the current outer vector, from index 0 to i. The resize function is used to ensure that each outer vector has the correct size for the current row.

The if statement checks if the current element is either the first or last element of the row (i.e., if j is equal to 0 or i). In these cases, the element is set to 1, as these are the first and last elements of each row of Pascal's triangle. Otherwise, the element is set to the sum of the two elements above it in the previous row of Pascal's triangle.


  return generate;
  
Finally, the function returns the completed generate vector.

Overall, this code generates and returns the first numRows rows of Pascal's triangle as a vector of vectors of integers.
