Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's triangle is a mathematical construct consisting of a triangular array of numbers. The numbers in the triangle are generated by summing the two numbers above them. The first and last numbers in each row are 1.

For example, here are the first five rows of Pascal's triangle:

```
        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
 ```
Code Explanation
The code uses two functions to generate Pascal's triangle.

The first function, generateRow(row), takes an input row and generates the corresponding row of Pascal's triangle. It does this by iterating over each column in the row and calculating the value of that column based on the two values above it. The result is stored in a vector and returned.

The second function, generate(numRows), takes an input numRows and generates the first numRows rows of Pascal's triangle. It does this by calling the generateRow() function for each row and storing the result in a vector of vectors. The final result is a 2D vector representing the entire Pascal's triangle.

Here's the code with block formatting:

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> generateRow(int row) {
        long long ans = 1;
        vector<int> ansRow;
        ansRow.push_back(1);
        for (int col = 1; col < row; col++){
            ans = ans * (row - col);
            ans = ans / (col);
            ansRow.push_back(ans);
        }
        return ansRow;
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> generate(int numRows) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        for (int i = 1; i <= numRows; i++){
            ans.push_back(generateRow(i));
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
